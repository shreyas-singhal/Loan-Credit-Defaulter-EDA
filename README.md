# Loan-Credit-Defaulter-EDA
In the traditional banking methods the loan approval process was extremely slow and risky.
▪ Before credit history was also difficult to identify.
▪ If a customers credit history was good then bank has no problem in giving loans to him, but if the credit
  history is not present and then too bank provide them loans then customer could use the same as their
  advantage by becoming a defaulter.
▪ But at the same time if the customer is capable of paying the loan and bank doesn’t give them loans this
  would result in a loss to bank.
▪ As the technology is growing we need to find an Intelligent Business Solution to overcome this problem.
▪ Exploratory Data Analysis is one of the Intelligent Solutions.
▪ By considering the Past Data, applying the Past Data into Present Data we can predict the future.
▪ Future is whether giving loan to a particular customer will result in loss or profit to bank.
▪ Whether that specific customer will repay the loan or not in future.
